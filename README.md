# iOS playground

This is an iOS Playground!

## Getting Started:

### 1. `git clone` project to your local machine.
### 2. Open `playground.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
### 3. Install project dependencies (Swift Package Manager) and run.

## TODO:
1. Present a 7-day Forecast sheet from the landing screen (stubbed TableViewController and Forecast model exist)
2. A previous dev tried this and noticed that the forecasts keep changing. Can you fix that?
3. Design now wants it to be a standard NavigationController-type interface instead of a sheet.
4. A new weather forecast writer started and now some of the descriptions are twice as long - can you make sure the tableView still looks ok?
5. Design says it's great but they don't know where the forecast is for - can you add a header to the forecast table view?
